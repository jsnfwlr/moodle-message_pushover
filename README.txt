This plugin is a message provider that allows push notifications via the pushover.net service. An app token is required from pushover.net to allow for messages to be sent to your client devices. Each client device needs the client application (available from the Google Play store or Apple iTunes store for a small fee) and a user token to work correctly.

Once installed, configure the message provider with the app token, and the users who wish to recieve push notifications with a user token. Then configure which messages are to be sent as push notifications. All done!
